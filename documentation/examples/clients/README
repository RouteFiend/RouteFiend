This folder contains examples which show how to connect to the
PHP/Java Bridge from PYTHON and Chicken/SCHEME.


* getProperties.py: Connects to the PHP/Java Bridge, asks for
  System.getProperties() and displays the first entry. 

  Start the server with java -jar JavaBridge.jar and invoke the
  example with:
 
    python getProperties.py
 

* listToArray.scm: Connects to the PHP/Java Bridge, creates a
  java.util.ArrayList and fills it with three entries. Then it receives
  the entire array list from the server and displays it.

  Start the server with java -jar JavaBridge.jar and run the example with:

    csi listToArray.scm


* getProperties.scm: Connects to the PHP/Java Bridge, asks for
  System.getProperties(), receives the properties dictionary and
  prints it as a HTML table using the formatArray.xsl transformer.

  Start the server with java -jar JavaBridge.jar, compile the scheme file
  into native code and invoke it:

    csc -lxslt getProperties.scm && ./getProperties |tee out.html

  After that you can examine the out.html with a web browser.


* sample.php: A pure PHP example which communicates directly with the
  server.

  Start the server with java -jar JavaBridge.jar and invoke the
  example with:
 
    php sample.php


These examples use the python and Scheme script languages. They can be
obtained from:

   http://www.python.org

and

   http://directory.fsf.org/chicken.html  or
   http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/chicken.html

The Scheme code in example #3 calls the libxslt.so library to apply
the XSLT transformation. It is part of the GNOME project and can be
optained from http://www.gnome.org if it isn't already installed on
your computer.
