These examples show how to create GUI applications with PHP.

* swt-button.php: Uses SWT to create a native GUI on windows or
  unix. SWT is part of eclipse and can be downloaded from
  www.eclipse.org.

* swing-button.php: This example has been moved to
  tests.php5/swing-button.php. A better example can be found in
  server/test/SwingButton.java and server/test/SwingButton.php: Unlike
  other toolkits the swing toolkit creates artifical background
  threads which cause trouble, see the java bug parade for details,
  therefore the best way to use swing is to write a swing application in
  pure java and use php as an extension/plugin only.

* gtk-button.php: This example uses mono gtk. You need the
  PHP/Mono+Net Bridge and gtk-sharp installed on the system.

* gtk-fileselector.php: An example which opens a file selector via
  mono gtk. You need the PHP/Mono+NET Bridge and gtk-sharp installed
  on the system.
