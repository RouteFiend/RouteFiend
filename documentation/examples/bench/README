This example creates two 200x200 excel sheets a) by calling a compiled
java class and b) by using 40000 java reflections calls from PHP.

When the java JIT compiler is switched off, this program can be used
to calculate the JNI/reflection overhead.

This example requires a library "poi.jar" which can be obtained from
apache.org or from http://php-java-bridge.sf.net/poi.jar.
