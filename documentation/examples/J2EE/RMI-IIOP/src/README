Building the documentBean.jar
-----------------------------

It is assumed that you use the Sun J2EE application server and that
your server is already installed in some directory, for example in
~/SUNWappserver.  The environment variable $app_server should point to
this directory.

1. Compile the java files, for example with the command:

   $app_server/jdk/bin/javac -classpath $app_server/lib/j2ee.jar:. *.java


2. Create the documentBean.jar file, for example with the command:

   $app_server/jdk/bin/jar cf ../documentBean.jar *
