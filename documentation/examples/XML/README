The examples in this directory show how to work with XML.

* html_to_text.php: Shows how to write PHP callbacks for a SAX
  parser. It captures the HTML output generated by the php cgi binary
  and uses the php callbacks to convert it into a text document. This
  example requires PHP 5. It might be possible to adapt the php code for
  PHP 4, but it will be slow because PHP 4 passes objects as values.
  In php4 the function:
    function characters ($chars, $start, $length)
    {
      $s = new java("java.lang.String", $chars, $start, $length);
      echo $s->toString();
    }
  would receive the entire document in $chars (as an array) just to
  send it back in the next call to create a sub-string.

* ellipse.php: Creates a SVG picture in the current directory.
