php-java-bridge NEWS -- history of user-visible changes.

Please send bug reports, questions and suggestions to
<php-java-bridge-users@lists.sourceforge.net>.

Version 6.2.1

* java_session(null, false) now returns false if a session does not exist.

* Added new BIRT version 2.6

* Incompatible change for those who use $_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"] as a cache key.
  Please either use PHP_SELF or please set 
    <init-param>
      <param-name>php_request_uri_is_unique</param-name>
      <param-value>true</param-value>
    </init-param>
  

* A (string) cast no longer converts a byte[] array to a 
  java.lang.String. Example:
 
  $s = new java("java.lang.String", "hello");
  $b = $s->getBytes("ASCII");
  echo (string)$b;
  
    
* To support both x64 and 386 windows dll's, the layout has been changed:

    WEB-INF --- cgi 
                   |
                    --- x86-windows --- conf.d --- mysql.ini [extension="php_mysql.dll"]
                   |               |
                   |                --- ext --- php_mysql.dll
                   |                --- php-cgi.exe <-- moved here
                   |
                   |
                   |
                    --- i386-linux --- conf.d --- mysql.ini [extension="mysql.so"]
                                  |
                                   --- ext --- mysql.so
                                   --- php-cgi      <-- moved here

* The FastCGI configuration has been moved from the FastCGIServlet servlet config to the ContextLoaderListener context.
  Please use <context-param parameter ... instead of <init-param servlet-parameter ...
  
* The PHP JSR 223 ScriptEngine API now supports the Compilable interface. Please see the php/java/tests JUnit tests.

* The EngineFactory has been removed. Scripts running within a servlet context (see ContextLoaderListener) can
  now use a ScriptContext decorator to access the FastCGI runner associated with the ContextLoaderListener. 
  A sample decorator can be found in php.java.script.servlet.PhpCompiledHttpScriptContext
  

Version 6.1.2.1

* Security fix: Even if the PHP option allow_url_include it set, it is
  no longer possible to load arbitrary resources using the JSR 223
  script interface. The following eval() will fail if the "remote"
  interface is not 127.0.0.1:

<%!
private static final Reader R = EngineFactory.createPhpScriptReader("<?php function f($a) {return 'hello '.$a;}; ?>");
%>
<%
Reader r = EngineFactory.createPhpScriptFileReader(getClass().getName()+"._cache_.inc", R);
ScriptEngine e = 
  EngineFactory.getInvocablePhpScriptEngine (this,
                               application, request, response, 
			       new URI("http://127.0.0.1/java/JavaProxy.php"););
try {

  // inject the above PHP code into the PHP app server and execute it
  // will fail if the URI is not http://127.0.0.1/...
  e.eval(r); r.close();

  // call the injected code
  Object result = ((Invocable)e).invokeFunction("f", new Object[]{"you"});
  out.println ("result: " + result);

} catch (Exception ex) {
 out.println(ex);
} finally { 
  ((Closeable)e).close()
}
%>


Version 6.1.2

* The bridge now sets the config dir to cgi/OS-ARCH/conf.d. It makes
  it easier to add custom PHP extensions to the Java web
  application. Please see the phpinfo() output.

  Example for the PHP mysql extension for Linux and Windows (i386/x86):

    WEB-INF --- cgi --- php-cgi-x86-windows.exe
                   |
                    --- x86-windows --- conf.d --- mysql.ini [extension="php_mysql.dll"]
                   |               |
                   |                --- ext --- php_mysql.dll
                   |
                   |
                    --- php-cgi-i386-linux
                   |
                    --- i386-linux --- conf.d --- mysql.ini [extension="mysql.so"]
                                  |
                                   --- ext --- mysql.so

  Please see the FAQ entry "I want to ship my own PHP web
  application. Where do I put PHP and PHP extensions?" for details.

* The "servlet engine" built into JavaBridge.jar now handles PHP/Java
  Bridge protocol requests as efficient as a real servlet engine back
  end; 

    java -jar JavaBridge.jar SERVLET_LOCAL:8080 

  now uses HTTP/1.1 Transfer-Encoding: chunked. Example:

telnet localhost 8080

PUT /JavaBridge/servlet.phpjavabridge HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

22
<H p="1" v="java.lang.String"></H>
b
<F p="E" />
0


* It is now easy to use the bridge back-end in an existing
  servlet. Example code:

  public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {
    ...
    public String hello() { return "hello from MyServlet"; }
    ...
    protected void doPut (HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws ServletException, IOException {
       IContextFactory ctx = new RemoteHttpServletContextFactory(this, getServletContext(), req, req, res);
       res.setHeader("X_JAVABRIDGE_CONTEXT", ctx.getId());
       res.setHeader("Pragma", "no-cache");
       res.setHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache");
       try { ctx.handleRequests(req.getInputStream(), res.getOutputStream()); } finally { ctx.destroy(); }
     }
  }

  If MyServlet listens on localhost:8080/MyWebApp/MyServlet, PHP scripts can call it:

  <?php
    define("JAVA_HOSTS", "localhost:8080");
    define("JAVA_SERVLET", "/MyWebApp/MyServlet");
    require_once("java/Java.inc");
    
    echo java_context()->getServlet()->hello();
  ?>


Version 6.1.1

* The bridge now supports all available PHP stream transports. Example:

  <?php require_once("https://secure-host.com:8443/JavaBridge/java/Java.inc");
    echo java_context()->getHttpServletRequest()->getScheme();
    echo ", ";
    echo java_server_name();
  ?>        

  The above is equivalent to: 

  <?php
    define("JAVA_HOSTS", "ssl://secure-host.com:8443");
    define("JAVA_SERVLET", "/JavaBridge/servlet.phpjavabridge");
    require_once("java/Java.inc");

    echo java_context()->getHttpServletRequest()->getScheme();
    echo ", ";
    echo java_server_name();
  ?>

  => https, ssl://my-secure-host.com:8443

  Please see the PHP documentation stream_get_transports() for
  details.

Version 6.1.0

* Some Windows PHP install procedures destroy a local PHP executable
  by setting a "PHPRC" environment variable. This environment variable
  may have been useful in the past, but it disturbs modern PHP executables.
  Environment entries passed to PHP are now filtered through a blacklist, 
  see PHP_ENV_BLACKLIST in global.properties in JavaBridge.jar. 
  The list can be changed as usual. Example global.properties file:
  
    PHP_ENV_BLACKLIST = KEY1 KEY2 KEYN
    
  Example command line:
  
    java -Dphp.java.bridge.php_env_blacklist="key1 key2 keyN" -jar JavaBridge.jar ...
    

Version 6.0.0

* Apache or IIS PHP scripts can now use "java_virtual()" to include
  the output of JSP scripts, Java servlets or Java frameworks into PHP
  pages.

* MS .NET support has been removed: The "MonoBridge.exe" is not
  available anymore.

* Support for GNU "Java", GNU Autoconf/Makefile has been removed: The
  only remaining targets "JavaBridgeTemplate.war" and "JavaBridge.war"
  can now be build by a java "ant" build script.

* FreeBSD support has been removed: The "unix domain" socket channel
  (implemented by a JNI "libnatcJavaBridge.so") cannot be used
  anymore, therefore the bridge will be very slow on this operating
  system kernel. FreeBSD users must use local TCP sockets and switch
  off the Nagle algorithm or fix their kernel or add a TCP_NDELAY
  option to the PHP streams implementation.

* Dynamic class loading has been removed: The java_require() procedure
  is not available anymore. Please use standard JEE or servlet
  autodeployment instead.

* Support for the Tomcat "CGIServlet.java" has been removed: PHP must
  support the FastCGI SAPI. PHP >= 5.2.0 support the FastCGI SAPI by
  default. If you have a php-cgi binary < version 5.2.0, recompile it
  with the --enable-fastcgi option. The FastCGI servlet has been
  rewritten to support HTTP/1.1 chunked connections and the
  "WebSockets" protocol used by google "Chrome".

* The named pipe communication channel has been removed: On Security
  Enhanced Linux please use HTTP/1.1 chunked connections instead.

* The servlet or JEE back end must support HTTP/1.1 chunked
  connections or the communication will fail. This has been tested on
  the following AS: Glassfish, Jetty 7, Tomcat, Oracle/BEA WebLogic, Sun
  AS 9.

* The low-level protocol has not been changed. But due to the above
  changes an old "Java.inc" might not work with a new JavaBridge.war
  back end anymore. Please make sure to upgrade your "Java.inc" PHP
  library.


Version 5.5.5

* PHP scripts running within a JEE server can now use PHP paths like:
  
    .../MOODLE/dir/do.php/something?with=what 

  This feature can be switched off by removing the <filter> and
  <filter-mapping> from the web application web.xml.

* PHP scripts running within a JEE server now use java.io.tmpdir as
  their the session.save_path. This can be changed as usual, see
  php.java.bridge.global.properties PHP_EXEC_ARGS. Use
  Util.DEFAULT_PHP_ARGS as a template.

* A beta test version of the PHPDebugger is now part of the PHP/Java
  Bridge.

* The build system doesn't create RunJavaBridge and RunMonoBridge
  executables anymore. java.so, libnatcJavaBridge.so and a "java"
  binary are still created for compatibility with GNU "gcj"
  "Java". Please ignore or delete them if you're using Java instead of
  GNU "gcj" "Java".

Version 5.5.4.1

* The "JBoss" application server abuses the log4j port 4445 for its
  internal purposes. The bridge now switches off log4j "chainsaw" if
  getServletContext().getServerInfo().startsWith("JBoss").

* The namespace separator "_" (e.g.: new org_foo_bar_baz(...) syntax),
  which has been used by some projects, is available again. However,
  new projects should use the official namespace separator, which
  defaults to "\".

* If the option -Dphp.java.bridge.default_log_file= is set, the bridge
  switches off log4j chainsaw completely.

* The default value of php_include_java has been set to Off.

* A configuration option has been added to the JavaBridgeTemplate.war
  which sets php_include_java to On.

* Bugfix: If php_include_java is set, global PHP variables are no
  longer discarded; the PHP scripts are required from the top-level
  environment.


Version 5.5.4

* Bugfix: Throwing JavaException w/o messages is possible again.

* A bug has been fixed in the JSR 223 handling which could cause the
  JSR 223 script engine to crash. See the ChangeLog for details.

* If the Java environment doesn't allow java.lang.Threads, Sockets, or
  if the back end doesn't run on localhost
  ("127.0.0.1".equals(req.getRemoteAddr()), or if the promiscuous
  option is set, the bridge now uses a HTTP tunnel to communicate with
  the back end.  Example:

  --
  telnet YOURHOST.com 8080 
PUT /JavaBridge/foo.phpjavabridge HTTP/1.1
Host: YOURHOST.com:8080
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

22
<H p="1" v="java.lang.String"></H>
b
<F p="E" />
0

   --

* Due to the new communication channel, version 5.5.4 may not be
  compatible with earlier versions. Please make sure to upgrade both,
  the "Java.inc" PHP library and the "JavaBridge.jar" Java library.

* An option "java.persistent_servlet_connections" has been added to
  the java.ini. Due to a bug in some Tomcat versions,
  JAVA_PERSISTENT_SERVLET_CONNECTIONS cannot be used with
  Transfer-Encoding: chunked. Tomcat 6.0.14 sends back a valid body
  without Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding: chunked if it wants to
  close a persistent chunked connection via Connection: close (see
  tomcats connectionTimeout setting). An attempt to use the new
  communication channel with JAVA_PERSISTENT_SERVLET_CONNECTIONS 
  raises a fatal error immediately. Either enable the Pipe- or
  SocketContextServer or disable JAVA_PERSISTENT_SERVLET_CONNECTIONS
  in your PHP script or in the java.ini

* The promiscuous option is not required anymore. If set as a context
  parameter, it switches off the Pipe- and SocketContextServer. 
  Example web.xml:

    ...
    </listener>

    <!-- force the bridge to use the HTTP tunnel -->
    <context-param>
      <param-name>promiscuous</param-name>
      <param-value>On</param-value>
    </context-param>

    <context-param>
      <param-name>override_hosts</param-name>
    ...


* The option -Dphp.java.bridge.default_log_file=FILE redirects all log
  output to FILE. The following example sends all log output to
  standard out: JAVA_OPTS="-Dphp.java.bridge.default_log_file="
  bin/catalina.sh run

* The JAVA_DEBUG option has been removed from Java.inc, so that
   Java.inc fits into 64K. Use JavaBridge.inc from the src.zip or a
   PHP source level debugger (for example the Zend Debugger) if you
   want to debug the PHP bridge code.


Version 5.5.3

* The bridge can now handle java.lang.RuntimeException/Errors: If the
  option JAVA_PREFER_VALUES is set, each RuntimeException/Error is
  thrown as a PHP JavaException. Otherwise java_last_exception_get()
  can be used to fetch the last RuntimeException/Error. Example:

   define ("JAVA_PREFER_VALUES", false);
   require ("http://localhost:8080/JavaBridge/java/Java.inc");

   try {
     @new java("java.lang.String", null);
     if ($ex = java_last_exception_get()) {
       echo "OOPS, ";
       java_last_exception_clear();
       throw $ex;
     }
   } catch (JavaException $e) {
    echo "Received Exception or Error:" . $e->getMessage();
   }

* java_begin_document()/java_end_document() are now dummy calls and
  have been removed from the documentation.

* java_last_exception_get()/java_last_exception_clear() are no longer
  deprecated.
  

Version 5.5.1

* Improved unix-domain socket handling: If

    java.socketname=/path/to/some/unix.socket

  is set in the php ini file, the bridge starts a Java process
  listening on that socket.

* Improved local tcp socket handling: If 

    define ("JAVA_SERVLET", false);
    define ("JAVA_HOSTS", PORT); // e.g.: PORT = 9090

  is set before including Java.inc, the bridge starts a Java process
  listening on that port.

* Improved JSR 223 standalone invocable script engine: When running in
  standalone mode, the InvocablePhpScriptEngine can now connect to a
  remote PHP application server, too. Example:

  PHP script "hello.php":
   <?php require_once("java/Java.inc");
    function f() {return java_server_name();};
    java_call_with_continuation(java_closure());
   ?>

  The Java code:
    ScriptEngine e = (new ScriptEngineManager()).getEngineByName("php-invocable");
    e.eval(new php.java.script.URLReader(new URL("http://localhost/hello.php")));
    System.out.println(((Invocable)e).invokeMethod(e.get("php.java.bridge.PhpProcedure"), "f", new Object[]{}));
    ((Closeable)e).close();
 

Version 5.5

* mono_closure() and java_closure no longer try to determine the type
  automatically, pass the type as the third argument. Instead of:

  $win->add_DeleteEvent (new Mono("Gtk.DeleteEventHandler", 
         mono_closure($this, "delete")));

  use:

  $win->add_DeleteEvent (new Mono("Gtk.DeleteEventHandler", 
         mono_closure($this, "delete", mono('Gtk.DeleteEventHandler$Method'))));

  instead.

* The current PHP continuation is now available from the engine scope,
  key "php.java.bridge.PhpProcedure".

* The bridge tries to autoload Java classes by default. For example

    use java\lang\String as Str; echo new Str("hello");

  will autoload the class JString. This can be switched off with
  define("JAVA_DISABLE_AUTOLOAD", true); before including Java.inc.


* PHP 5.3 classes can now extend Java classes easily. For example:

  <?php 
    use java\lang\String as JString;

    class String extends JString {
      function toString() { return "I am" . parent::toString(); }
    }

    $str = new String(" a php/java string");
    echo $str->toString ();
  ?>


* Since PHP 5.3 TYPE::procedure() can be used instead of
  TYPE::type()->procedure().

  <?php 
    use java\lang\System as Sys;

    echo Sys::getProperties();
    // equivalent to echo Sys::type()->getProperties()
  ?>

  However, to access a static procedure with the name "type" or a
  sub-type of a type, you still have to use the TYPE::type(SUBTYPE)
  syntax.
    

* Improved array handling:

  $l = new java("java.util.ArrayList", array(1,2,3));
  echo isset($l[3])?"t":"f";
  => f
  $l[] = 4;
  echo isset($l[3])?"t":"f";
  => t
  unset($l[3]);
  echo isset($l[3])?"t":"f";
  => f
  print_r(java_cast($l, "array"));
  => array((object)1, (object)2, (object)3);
  print_r(java_values($l));
  => array(   (int)1,    (int)2,    (int)3);


* The bridge no longer throws java.lang.RuntimeException or
  java.lang.Error unless these exceptions are declared in the
  procedure or method definition.


Version 5.4.4.2

* A fast path has been added so that scripts running within a java
  servlet engine or J2EE server can access their Java back end. This
  can be switched off by setting the PhpCgiServlet init-param
  php_include_java to Off.

* A fast path has been added so that scripts running within a java
  servlet engine or J2EE server consume only one continuation. This
  means that the bridge can now run on engines which have a limited
  thread pool without having to check for a potential dead-lock
  (e.g. thread pool is full of servlets waiting for another servlet to
  start). This short path can be switched off by setting the system
  property php.java.bridge.no_short_path=true.

* java_invoke is now an official API method

* java_require() documentation has been removed. It is and will be
  supported, but new users should use tomcat/jee hot deployment
  instead.

* It is now much easier to install the bridge for all Java web
  applications or to add it to existing Java web application. Only the
  JavaBridge, php-servlet and php-script jar files and 9 lines of
  standard XML configuration are needed, see our
  FAQ.html#global-servlet for details.

* RequestDispatcher.include() can now be used with the PHP
  servlet. The servlet now checks if javax.servlet.include.* exists
  and uses these arguments instead of the original arguments obtained
  via reqest.getRequestURL() etc.

* The php.java.script.servlet.EngineFactory API has been revised.


Version 5.4.4.1

* Remote PHP scripts can now be accessed as usual. The code:

  <%@page import="java.io.*" %>
  <%@page import="javax.script.*" %>
  <%@page import="php.java.script.servlet.EngineFactory" %>
  <%
   ScriptEngine e = 
     EngineFactory.getInvocablePhpScriptEngine (this,
                                 application, request, response, 
                    new java.net.URI("http://foo:80/myApp/JavaProxy.php"));

   String result = (String)((Invocable)e).invokeFunction("phpversion", 
                                                            new Object[]{});
   ((Closeable)e).close();
   out.println("yourApp running PHP version:" + result);
  %>

Will eval "phpversion()" on the server foo and return the result.

There must not be a firewall in between and both components should be
behind a firewall.


Version 5.4.4


* The handling of J2EE JSR 223 script engines (and scripts executed
within a J2EE server) has been changed. They are no longer reclaimed
automatically when they are idle for more than 15 seconds. Please see
the ChangeLog file for details.

* A system FastCGI server executable is now executed from the PATH.


Version 5.4.3.3

* The binary download has been split into a JavaBridgeTemplate5433.war
  and a php-java-bridge_5.4.3.3_documentation.zip.


Version 5.4.3.2

* A shutdown hook can now be used to automatically shut down libraries
  when the (servlet-) context is destroyed.

* Invocable script engines are automatically destroyed when the 
  (servlet-) context is destroyed.

* Invocable script engines are no longer automatically destroyed at
  the end of the request, as users may want to store them in the
  application store for example. Use ((Closeable)engine).close() to
  destroy a script engine explicitly.

* The convenience procedures getHttpServletResponse(),
  getHttpServletRequest(), getServlet(), getServletConfig(),
  getServletContext(), getRealPath() have been added to the the
  java_context().

* On Solaris the directory /tmp is used instead of /dev/shm to create
  the named pipes.

* An Eclipse BIRT report example is included.

* Users who want to run php from Java, can pass arguments via
  -Dphp.java.bridge.php_exec_args=ARGS. ARGS must be a list of
  java.net.URLEncoded arguments, separated by a space. User-provided
  PHP_EXEC_ARGS replace the standard args, which are: "-d
  allow_url_include=On -d display_errors=Off -d log_errors=On -d
  java.persistent_servlet_connections=On".

Version 5.4.3.1

* java_unwrap($closure) can now used to retrieve the PHP object
  associated with a java_closure(). Example:

    class f{function __toString(){return "p";}function toString(){return "j"}};
    $cl = java_closure(new f());
    echo $cl;
    => j
    $cl = java_unwrap($cl)
    echo $cl;
    => p


Version 5.4.2

* JavaBridge.jar now supports a -Dphp.java.bridge.daemon=true option.
  When this option is set, the bridge ignores all other options,
  closes the in-, out- and error streams immediately and runs
  as a daemon. Example

	<html>
	<head/>
	<body>
	<form method="POST" action="<?php $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']?>">
	  <input type="submit" value="java_start" name="java_start">
	  <input type="submit" value="java_stop" name="java_stop">
	  <input type="submit" value="java_properties" name="java_properties">
	</form>
	<?php require_once("java/Java.inc");
	
	if (strtoupper(substr(PHP_OS, 0, 3)) === 'WIN') {
	  $JAVA="javaw";
	} else {
	  $JAVA="nohup java";
	}
	
	if (isset($_POST["java_start"])) {
	  echo 
	    system("$JAVA -Dphp.java.bridge.daemon='true' -jar java/JavaBridge.jar SERVLET_LOCAL:8080");
	  exit (0);
	}
	
	if (isset($_POST["java_stop"])) {
	  $file = fsockopen("127.0.0.1", 8080) or die ("java not running");
	  fwrite($file, "PUT /JavaBridge/JavaBridge.phpjavabridge HTTP/1.0\r\nHost: localhost\r\nContent-Length: 71\r\n\r\n<C v=\"java.lang.System\" p=\"C\" /><I v=\"1\" m=\"exit\" p=\"I\"><S v=\"0\" /></I>");
	  fclose ($file);
	  exit (0);
	}
	
	try {
	   echo java("java.lang.System")->getProperties();
	} catch (Exception $e) {
	  echo $e;
	}
	?>
	</body>
	</html>


Version 5.4.1

* If PHP is used within a J2EE server or servlet engine the option
  JAVA_PERSISTENT_SERVLET_CONNECTIONS is set. This means that the
  servlet option fcgi_children (see WEB-INF/web.xml) must be less than
  or equal to the servlet engine's thread pool size. It defaults to
  5. The smallest thread pool we've seen is the thread pool of the Sun
  J2EE server version 9, with 5 entries.

* If PHP is used within Apache or IIS via the java.so or
  php_java.dll the option JAVA_PERSISTENT_SERVLET_CONNECTIONS is
  set. This means that Apache/IIS "maxChilds" must be less than or
  equal to the servlet engine or J2EE server's "maxThreads" value,
  otherwise the additional PHP executables will hang. On Fedora and
  RedHat Linux we have verified that Tomcat's maxThreads == Apache
  maxChilds. If you're unsure, do not use the php_java.dll/java.so.

* Due to a bug in PHP versions < 5.3 persistent connections cannot be
  used on Windows. Please make sure to switch them off.

* All options can now be set on the command line. Example:

    php-cgi -djava.persistent_servlet_connections=On test.php


Version 5.3.4

* To be compatible with all operating systems, the bridge now uses
  a dummy round-trip during context switches, effectively reverting
  the change from version 5.3.3.


Version 5.3.3

* For context switches the bridge now uses write-write-read on
  protocol level. 

* The PhpServlet* JSR 223 script engines have been rewritten to make
  it easier to call Apache or IIS PHP modules or libraries from
  servlets. Example:

  <%!
  /* Create a PHP script with a function f() */
  private static java.io.File script;
  private static java.io.File getScript(String path) {
    if(script!=null) return script;
    return script=EngineFactory.getPhpScript(path, new StringReader(
               "<?php function f($arg) {return 1 + java_values($arg); }; ?>"));
  }
  %>
  <%
  /* Create a standard script engine and invoke function f on http port 80 */
  ScriptEngine e = EngineFactory.getInvocablePhpScriptEngine (this, 
                                  application, request, response, "http", 80);
  File script = getScript(application.getRealPath(request.getServletPath()));
  FileReader reader = EngineFactory.createPhpScriptFileReader(script);
  e.eval (reader); reader.close();
  Object result=((Invocable)i).invokeFunction("f",new Object[]{new Integer(2)});
  ((Closeable)e).close(); // flush the output generated by invokeXXX
  out.println("result from php::f(), printed from the servlet: " + result);
  %>


Version 5.3.0

* The bridge now uses real PHP 6 namespaces. Example:

   java_autoload("lucene.jar");

   use org::apache::lucene;
   use org::apache::lucene::index;
   use org::apache::lucene::search;
   use org::apache::lucene::search::IndexSearcher as LuceneSearcher;

   $searcher = new LuceneSearcher(...);
   $term = new index::Term("name", "someTerm");
   $phrase = new search::PhraseQuery();
   
   $phrase->add($term);
   $hits = $searcher->search($phrase);


Version 5.2.3

* Java boolean values now display as 0/1:

    echo ((bool)(string)new java("java.lang.Boolean", false)) ? "#t":"#f";
    => #f
    echo ((bool)(string)new java("java.lang.Boolean", true )) ? "#t":"#f";
    => #t

Version 5.2.2.4

* The mono.so does not interfere with the pure Java PHP/Java Bridge
  implementation anymore.

Version 5.2.2.3

* The deprecated php_java.dll and java.so may trash the pure Java
  PHP/Java Bridge implementation.  Revert all changes made by the
  java.so or php_java.dll and use our own settings.

Version 5.2.2.2

* The JSR223 scripts can now be cached. See jsp+php.jsp and jsr223.jsp
  for details.

* The standalone component now uses a very restrictive security
  setting by default. It can be switched off in java.ini.


Version 5.2.2

* This version contains bug fixes only.


Version 5.2.1

* java_isnull() or java_is_null() can be used to test for a Java NULL value. 
  It is equivalent to is_null (java_values ($javaObject)));


Version 5.2.0

* The Java type has been removed from java.so and php_java.dll. To
  access Java, use
  
    require_once ("java/Java.inc");

* java_require("foo.jar;...") and java_autoload("foo.jar;...")
  override the libraries from the global class path.


Version 5.1.0

* This release contains only bugfixes.

* The procedure which calculates the weight of the potential method
  candidates has been rewritten. It is compatible with Sam Ruby's code
  written for PHP 4 except that arrays with a non matching component
  type have a much larger weight.

* The bridge now uses the same code as zend_eval_string() to load
  the PHP code into the zend engine. If your debugger or some other
  component "xxx" crashes in xxx_execute(), check if it honors the 
  EG(no_extensions)==1 flag.

* The bridge no longer tries to load libraries from
  php.java.bridge.base/lib. Use java.ext.dirs instead.


Version 5.0.0

This version is no longer backward compatible with earlier versions:

* Undeclared exceptions thrown by Java procedures can no longer be
  caught by PHP code. This change may cause confusion, but it is
  consistent with other container implementations, for example EJB.

* No automatic Java -> PHP value conversion. Use java_values($javaValue) 
  to retrieve the value from a Java proxy.[1]

* Java NULL values are represented as PhpNull proxies. Use java_values()
  to retrieve the value.[1]

[1] Note that in PHP versions <= 5.3

  class Clazz { function __toString() {return "42"; } }
  var_dump((int)(string)new Clazz());

works correctly but 

  var_dump((int)new Clazz());

does not. This means that if you want to convert an object into
a value, you must convert it into a string first.
    

Version 4.3.3

This release contains bug fixes only. The following "bugs" have
been fixed:

* The asynchronous protocol can now be used everywhere. Please see
  examples/bench/bench.php for details.

* The Apache/IIS front end and the tomcat back end can be restarted
  independently. Tomcat doesn't keep references to old classes when
  the context is reloaded.

* When gcj is used, dynamic proxies are created by the default
  classloader. This is necessary because gcj doesn't have a class GC.

* The JSR223 script engines now wait for the SimpleContextFactory to
  finish. In previous versions the script engines were recycled at the
  end of the PHP script, not at the end of the PHP to Java
  communication.

* The old C implementation has been removed. PHP 4 is not supported
  anymore.


Version 4.3.1

* JSP or servlets can now access PHP as follows:

  <%  out.println ("I AM A SERVLET ... "); 
      javax.script.ScriptEngine e = 
        php.java.script.EngineFactory.getPhpScriptEngine 
                                       (this, application, request, response);
      e.getContext().setWriter (out);
      e.eval ("<?php echo '... AND I AM AN EMBEDDED PHP SCRIPT';?>");
      e.eval ("<?php echo java_inspect (java_closure()); ?>");
  %>

  The InvocablePhpScriptEngine can be retrieved with 
  EngineFactory.getInvocablePhpScriptEngine(...);


Version 4.3.0

* A php-java-bridge-mono RPM is now available.

* Renamed JavaBridge to VMBridge.

* It is now possible to access PHP (HTTP- or FastCGI) pool instances
from servlets or frameworks such as Spring or JSF using the JSR 223
API. See script/EngineFactory.java and servlet/ContextLoaderListener.java.

* New high-level API:

 java_autoload() or java_autoload("foo.jar;bar.jar;...");
 echo new java_lang_String("hello");
 => hello

 echo java_lang_String::type();
 => type: java.lang.String

 echo java_lang_Boolean::type()->TYPE;
 => primitive type: boolean

 echo php_java_bridge_Util::type("Logger");
 => type: php.java.bridge.Util$Logger

 echo php_java_bridge_Util::type('ProcessWithErrorHandler$PhpException');
 => type: php.java.bridge.Util$ProcessWithErrorHandler$PhpException


Version 4.2.0

* This is an experimental release.

* A cache has been added to the pure PHP PHP/Java Bridge
implementation. If enabled, scripts which call a java routine more
than once will execute up to 7 times faster.


Version 4.1.8

* The old C extension doesn't exist anymore. 

* For backward compatibility the file "java.c" loads "Java.inc",
compiles and caches it. Although this temporarily makes the C
implementation up to 10 times slower (due to a slow XML parser/writer
on PHP level), it allows us to use certain optimizations on opcode
level. Furthermore the C-based XML parser and XML writer is still
there and will be used by the pure PHP/Java Bridge implementation in
the future.

* Since the C extension doesn't use any object-level API's anymore (at
the moment it uses only zend_compile() and zend_execute()), it will
compile against all future versions of the zend engine. Furthermore it
should now be easy to compile it on operating systems which don't
support autoconf.

* The user option java.persistent_connections has been
removed. Persistent connections are always switched on in PHP >= 5.

* The pure PHP/Java Bridge implementation looks for a function
"java_get_default_channel()". If it exists and returns a string or
integer, the bridge will use this port number. It is used by Apache or
IIS to communicate the port number of the Java sub component (if any)
to PHP. Outside of Apache/IIS this can be used as follows:

  # start java from a service script 
  java -jar JavaBridge.jar INET_LOCAL:9876 

  # In each PHP script define the default channel# before 
  # loading Java.inc
  if(!function_exists("java_get_default_channel")) {
   function java_get_default_channel() { return 9876; }
   require_once("java/Java.inc");
  }
  echo java("java.lang.System")->getProperties();


Version 4.1.7

* Forcibly switched off java.persistent connections when the C front
end is used with a J2EE back end. The persistent connection handling
in java.c was a hack which assumed ownership of the back end. Now that
we support a J2EE cluster and the Apache load balancer, the C code
must be rewritten so that it uses the same algorithm as the pure
PHP/Java Bridge implementation: connect to the servlet to obtain the
session and the local channel#, then switch to the (persistent-)
channel.

* Removed all deprecated code from the back end. The back end 
now throws an exception if it is used with an old C front end.

Version 4.1.6

* Fixed a bug in the pure PHP/Java Bridge implementation, which did
not handle urls like http://foo.org//bar/baz.php correctly (the apache
load balancer emits such URL's).

* Apache load balancer supported. See the FAQ entry "How to I enable
load balancing for the PHP/Java Bridge cluster".

Version 4.1.5

* The simple web server built into the JavaBridge.jar can now handle
JSR223 scripts, directories and plain (html- and text-) files. This is
convenient for testing server-side script implementations such as PHP,
bean shell, ecma script, etc.

* The JavaBridge.war file is now marked as "distributable" and can be
used in a cluster environment. We have tested a Tomcat 6 cluster with
3 nodes running on different servers.


Version 4.1.3

* The bridge doesn't reset the log4j configuration if chainsaw is
listening on port 445.  To override the log4j configuration, set
java.log_file=@127.0.0.1:445 in the php.ini (C implementation). Or set
servlet_log_file to @127.0.0.1:447 in the WEB-INF/web.xml.

Version 4.1.1

* For compatibility with the pure PHP implementation the C
implementation now exports a java() function.

* The DynamicJavaBridgeClassLoader is now optional. The bridge
now uses the current web app class loader, wrapped by a URLClassLoader which
checks {php.java.bridge.base}/lib/. When the java_require() procedure is called,
the bridge enables the DynamicJavaBridgeClassLoader, which uses the current
URLClassLoader as a fall back.

* The PHP/Java Bridge can now be used in a shared environment. For example:
  require_once("http://localhost:8080/webApp1/Java.inc");
  java_require("myClass");
loads myClass from webApp1, even if JavaBridge.jar and php-servlet.jar were loaded
from the global class path.

* new JavaClass("NonPublicClass") or java("NonPublicClass") now immediately throw
an IllegalAccessException.

Version 4.0.8

* It is now possible to call JSP taglibs from (remote-) php
scripts. See tests.php5/tag.php for a test case.

* It is now possible to direct a PHP script to different back ends at
run-time. When the PHP script contains a

  require_once("http://myHost.com:8080/JavaBridge/java/Java.inc"),

statement, both, the C and the pure PHP implementation connect to
myHost.com on port 8080 instead of the local back end started with
Apache or IIS.

* The C implementation of java_cast now accepts values. For example
java_cast(1, "string") returns "1". This is consistent with the pure
PHP implementation

* A bug, introduced in version 4.0.1, has been fixed. The bridge
instance was removed too early, which caused a NullPointerExeption on
the server side if the PHP script contains only a
"java_get_server_name()" statement.

* The HTTP tunnel (used when both, the SocketContextServer and
PipeContextServer are switched off) works again, due to the above bug
fix.


Version 4.0.5

* It is now possible to access the ServletContext, ServletRequest and
Servlet from the remote context for not more than 30 seconds. See
tests.php5/testContextAwarePhpJavaServlet.php


Version 4.0.3

* A java.lang.String object now displays as a primitive type. Example:

$buf = new Java("java.lang.StringBuffer", "hello world");
$s = $buf->toString();
$s = $s->substring(0, 5);
echo $s; echo " is "; echo is_string($s) ? "" : "not "; echo "a php string\n";

=> hello is not a php string


Version 4.0.2

* FastCGI on Windows: FastCGI is default on all operating systems. The
bridge now uses its own "launcher.exe" and "named pipes" to
communicate with the FastCGI server. IBM's "launcher.exe", which was
required until now, should not be used anymore.

* The default standalone container does not start in promiscuous mode
anymore. Select SERVLET:8080 to enable it.

* Promiscuous mode: It is now possible to set promiscuous mode in the
servlet's WEB-INF/web.xml. A web page, "settings.php", has been added
which displays the current PHP/Java Bridge settings from the web.xml.

* Java.inc loads much faster: If no accelerator technology ("php
opcode cache") is used, the bridge loads much faster. Java.inc has
been renamed to JavaBridge.inc and Java.inc is auto-generated from
Java.inc.

* The error message format has been changed. It now displays the
required parameter types and the passed argument types. Example: The
error message "System->getProperty((o:String)[c:String]) failed ..."
means that an instance of the String class is required, not the String
class itself.

* Persistent connections: The pure PHP implementation now supports
override redirect, named-pipe communication and persistent
connections. On Unix the implementation uses named pipes unless the
back end is running on a different computer and/or promiscuous mode is
enabled. On all other operating systems the implementation uses
persistent tcp sockets ("pfsockopen"). As a side effect the
implementation now understands "override redirect", which means that
java_session() can be called anywhere.

Version 4.0.1

* It is no longer necessary to install the PHP/Java Bridge on a
computer. The following code connects to the server "myServer" and
calls System.getProperties():

  require_once("http://myServer.8080/JavaBridge/java/Java.inc");
  $s = new Java("java.lang.System");
  echo $s->getProperties();

* The JavaBridge.jar is now executable, so that Java 1.6 users can
simply double-click on it to start the bridge for all computers on the
local network.

* PHP 4 and PHP 5.0 are no longer supported (obsolete). If you want to
use PHP 4 or PHP 5.0.x, please see the README from the
php-java-bridge-legacy.zip download.

* The special installation instructions for Oracle and IBM WebSphere
have been removed (obsolete).

* Most of the features of the PHP/Java Bridge require Java 1.6. Old
Java versions (gcj "GNU Java", Java 1.4 and Java 1.5) need the legacy
library "script-api.jar" which is contained in the JavaBridge.war.

* The Java Server Faces bindings are not supported anymore. Use the
script API instead.

* The php script engine doesn't implement the Invocable interface
anymore. Please use the php-invocable script engine instead.


Version 3.2.1

* The pure PHP PHP/Java Bridge is now the reference implementation.

* A PHP script implementation for J2SE is available. For example it
can be used to install PHP as a script plugin into a Java report
engine such as BIRT; PHP can be used to evaluate formula fields, group
selection formulas, etc.

* A third optional parameter (timeout) has been added to the
java_session() implementation of the Java extension module, so that
the C extension module is now compatible with our pure PHP PHP/Java
Bridge implementation.

* gcc >= 3.3.3 is required to compile C PHP/Java Bridge implementation.

* Since PHP>= 5.2 the Windows java extension ("java-x86-windows.dll"
or "php_java.dll") is not necessary anymore. Please use our pure PHP
PHP/Java Bridge implementation instead.

* Fedora 6 Linux binary packages are available.

* Debian Linux packages are available.


Version 3.1.8 

* The recommended way to run Java is to start it via a servlet engine
or application server. A very simple servlet engine (less 200 lines of
Java code) is contained in the JavaBridge.jar and can be started with
the command: 

java -jar JavaBridge.jar SERVLET:8080 3 javabridge_servlet.log


* Incompatible change for those who run Java directly within Apache or
IIS: The bridge now looks for @channelName\n instead of
channelName. This means that both, the php_java.dll or java.so AND the
JavaBridge.jar must be upgraded. If you have copied the JavaBridge.jar
and the php_java.dll or java.so to the extension directory, make sure
that the version numbers match; the version number of the back end can
be found in the global.properties within the JavaBridge.jar zip file
and the version # of the front end can be checked by temporarily
setting java.socketname=0 and running the phpinfo() or the
test.php. However, users who run PHP in Apache or IIS and Java in a
servlet engine or J2EE AS are not affected.

* A pure PHP implementation of the PHP/Java Bridge is now available in
the "java" folder. This means that it is no longer necessary to
compile and to install a non-standard PHP extension on the web or J2EE
server.

* The license has been changed to LGPL.


Version 3.1.7:

* The php-java-bridge does not use Java anymore. The bridge and all
libraries which depend on it are compiled to native code. For backward
compatibility the bridge uses a real VM when the PHP .ini option
java.java=<java> is set or if the autoconf scripts do not detect a
sufficient compiler (gcc >= 3.2.3 is required).

* The Lucene4php and Itext4php libraries are now available as native code.

* The install instructions and install procedure for the standalone
component has been removed in favor of the J2EE or native
component. -- For those who know how to install the standalone
component: this option is still available and supported, but new users
should use the native or J2EE component instead.

* The INSTALL.WINDOWS document has been removed, please read the
INSTALL.J2EE document instead.

* The ext/java compatibility option has been removed.

* A cast to string now behaves as __toString(). In previous versions
"{$ex->__toString()}" was necessary to print the stack trace. The
following code now works as expected:

catch (JavaException $ex) {
  echo "Exception occured: $ex";
}


* FastCGI SAPI on Windows: On Windows the php-cgi.exe currently does
not support the required "-b" flag, therefore the bridge tries to
start a persistend php-cgi process via a program called
"launcher.exe".  It uses the following arguments:
...\WEB-INF\cgi\launcher.exe -a "path\to\php-cgi.exe" -b 9667. If this
fails (for example if launcher.exe does not exist), the bridge
switches off FastCGI after 1.5 seconds, as before. The "launcher.exe"
is not part of the PHP/Java Bridge download; IBM Websphere users can
find such a binary in the "PHP Integration Kit for Windows":
PHPIntKitForWindows.zip, available from alphaworks.

* java_session(<name>) with a non-null <name> does no longer allocate a
session from the J2EE container.

* The system property php.java.bridge.promiscuous=true can be used to
allow php clients running on the HTTP server to connect back to a J2EE
node running in the same intranet network. For example when the
HTTP/PHP web server is running on computer W and the tomcat cluster
nodes are on computer K1, ..., Kn, the nodes can be started with:

  JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk1.5 \
  JAVA_OPTS="-Dphp.java.bridge.promiscuous=true" \
    /opt/node_n_/tomcat/bin/catalina.sh start

The communication ports in the range [9267, ..., 9367[ must not be
accessible from the internet, of course.


Version 3.1.6:

* When the PhpJavaServlet or PhpCGIServlet is used globally (see
description in ABOUT.htm#global-servlet), the number of persistent
physical connections does no longer depend on the number of web
contexts. In a setup with k web contexts and n php clients previous
versions used up to k*n physical connections. Since version 3.1.6 each
php client uses exactly one persistent physical connection for all web
contexts unless a requested web context belongs to a different
JavaBridge implementation or server.


Version 3.1.5:

* PHP/Java exception chaining:

  <?
  require_once("rt/java_lang_String.php");
  function call() { new java_lang_String(null); }
  call();
  ?>

now prints a NullPointerException at:

  #-10 java.lang.String.<init>(String.java:144)
  [...]
  #0 /usr/share/pear/rt/java_lang_String.php(15): Java::__construct(Array)
  #1 printException.php(3): java_lang_String->__construct(NULL)
  #2 printException.php(4): call()
  #3 {main}

* The FastCGI and Apache SAPI now create the communication pipes in a
sub directory of /dev/shm/ or /tmp/ and clean it, whenever the server
stops or restarts.

* Each context now uses its own PHP FastCGI pool, if the context
init-param shared_fast_cgi_pool is Off and use_fast_cgi is set to
Autostart (default). In previous versions it was not possible to
deploy different versions into the same application server, because
each version used the JavaBridge FastCGI pool at 9667. Now each
context creates its own FastCGI pool above 9667, for backward
compatibility the pool of the "JavaBridge" context still uses the
fixed port #9667.

* Because of the above change the GlobalPhpCGIServlet now requires the
option shared_fast_cgi_pool=On, see ABOUT.HTM#global-servlet or
http://php-java-bridge.sf.net#global-servlet for details.

* The Mono back-end now redirects its stdout and stderr to the
specified log file.

* When unix domain sockets are not available, for example if the JNI
library libnatcJavaBridge.so cannot be loaded because a 32 bit JVM is
running on a 64 bit machine, autoconf switches off unix domain sockets
and uses TCP sockets instead. Security Enhanced Linux rules for TCP
socket communication have been added to the SEL TE files.

* A Security Enhanced Linux rule has been added to the TE files which
allows searching in http_sys_content_t. This means that it is now
possible to index files from these directories, for Lucene queries for
example. If additional rules are necessary (searching in other
directory types, etc.), use the commands:

setenforce 0;
# ... run the Lucene indexer ...
audit2allow -ld; (or audit2allow -l -i /var/log/audit/audit.log); 
setenforce 1;

and add the rules at the end of the SEL TE files. The files are:
security/module/*.te for Linux versions >= Fedora Core 5/RHEL5 or
security/*.te for Linux versions <= Fedora Core 4/RHEL4).


Version 3.1.4:

* The static loader can now load resources which are stored outside of
.jar files from Util.DEFAULT_EXTENSION_DIRS or from the PHP
extension_dir/lib directory.

Version 3.1.3:

* The default log level for the autostart back-end (cli) has been
changed from 2 to 1.

Version 3.1.2:

* Since java.lang.String.valueOf(object) does not necessarily return
the string representation of object (for example when object is a
dynamic proxy and programmed so that toString() returns null), the
PHP/Java Bridge now uses its own object->String conversion.

* It is now possible to create closures within other closures. This
means that java_closure() now works when running php in interactive
mode (with jrunscript -l php-interactive for example).

* The DynamicJavaBridgeLoader can now be used in environments which
make use of dynamic proxies, for example EJB or hibernate.

* The default TCP port doesn't exist anymore. On Windows, or if the
bridge has been compiled with -DCFG_JAVA_SOCKET_INET, and if
java.socketname is not set, the bridge back-end automatically selects
a free port number from the range [9267,...,9367[ (for JavaBridge.jar)
or [9167,...,9267[ (for MonoBridge.exe). Thus it is now possible to
autostart the bridge as a sub-component of IIS. If you don't want this
behaviour, set java.socketname=9267 (or mono.socketname=9167) and copy
the JavaBridge.jar or MonoBridge.exe executables into the autostart
folder of your computer.

* On MacOSX the bridge now uses the programs glibtool and glibtoolize
instead of libtool and libtoolize (if available), so that it is no
longer necessary to remove the non-GNU libtool program that came with
MacOSX.

* In the PHP .ini file the log4j logger can now be selected by
prefixing the java.log_file value with an "@" sign:

  java.log_file=@[HOST][:PORT]

Example:

  java.log_file=@127.0.0.1:4445


Version 3.1.1:

* The windows default location has been changed from c:\php5 to
c:\php.

* The servlet SAPI now supports HTTPS. The default communication port
is 127.0.0.1:9157 (see java.hosts in the WEB-INF/.../php*.ini). For
tomcat for example add the following entry marked with a + to the
conf/server.xml:

  <Service name="Catalina">
  [...]
+  <Connector port="9157" address="127.0.0.1"/>
  [...]
  </Service>

* The extension_dir/lib directory is no longer scanned by the
DynamicJavaBridgeClassLoader. All Java .jar and .class files located
in this directory are added to the system class path when the virtual
machine starts. This means that this directory can now contain impure
java libraries (=libraries which use the java native interface). But
this also means that the dynamic loader doesn't know whether a lib in
this directory has been changed or added. It is therefore recommended
to store required libraries into the sub-directory <PACKAGE-NAME>. For
example:

  java_require("myPackage/myLib.jar;j2eePackage/j2ee.jar");


* The ikvmc.exe and ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll IKVM.AWT.WinForms.dll
IKVM.GNU.Classpath.dll IKVM.Runtime.dll are now included. This means
that it is now possible to access .NET dll's without installing
additional software; ./configure --with-mono && make && make install is
enough to load/call .NET or Mono .dlls from PHP -- .NET or Mono must
be installed, of course.

* It is now possible to convert Java libraries into PHP code. 
For example the command java -jar JavaBridge.jar --convert
/usr/share/pear lucene.jar creates PHP lucene classes from
the Java lucene.jar. When the PHP/Java Bridge has been configured to
run without Java (./configure w/o the "--with-java" argument), the
created PHP lucene classes can be used directly from PHP code, Java is
not needed anymore. Only the java.so or php_java.dll file and the
generated Lucene PHP classes are required, for example:

<?php
require_once("lucene/org_apache_lucene_search_IndexSearcher.php")
require_once("lucene/org_apache_lucene_search_PhraseQuery.php")
require_once("lucene/org_apache_lucene_index_Term.php")

$searcher = new org_apache_lucene_search_IndexSearcher(getcwd());
$term = new org_apache_lucene_index_Term("name", "test.php");
$phrase = new org_apache_lucene_search_PhraseQuery();
$phrase->add($term);

$hits = $searcher->search($phrase);
$iter = $hits->iterator();

while($iter->hasNext()) {
  $next = $iter->next();
  $name = $next->get("name");
  echo "found: $name\n";
}
?>

* A binary RPM for RHEL3 is not available anymore. If you want to
install the bridge on RHEL3 please create a binary RPM from the source
RPM.

* Persistent connections: If "java.persistent_connections" is set to
"On", the Apache/Tomcat5 combination delivers a PHP/Java based mix more
or less as fast as Tomcat would deliver an equivalent JSP file.

* Log4j added: If java.log_file is not set, the bridge uses log4j, if
available. The default appender is log4j "chainsaw" (a stupid name for
a log viewer) listening on localhost:4445. Other appenders, for
example jdbc, can be configured by overriding ChainsawLogger.configure
or by calling Util.setLogger(ILogger).

* Improved dynamic loading: java_require(file) is now fail fast. It
checks if local jar files do exist and are accessible. However, urls
are loaded lazily. If the urls could not be loaded, the java_require()
call succeeds but one will receive a ClassNotFoundException later on.

For example:

// java_require(file) is fail fast
try {
  java_require("/usr/share/java/doesNotExist.jar"); // fails
} catch (JavaException $ex) {
  echo "doesNotExist library not installed\n";
  echo $ex->getCause();
}

// java_require(url) is lazy
java_require("http://doesNotExist.com/foo.jar"); // succeeds
...
try {
  $foo = new Java("foo");                        // fails
} catch (JavaException $ex) {
  echo "http://doesNotExist.com/foo.jar:foo.class could not be loaded\n";
  echo $ex->getCause();
}

* A standard global repository for java libraries has been added. The
standalone back-end adds the following standard extension directories
to java.ext.dirs: "/usr/java/packages/lib/ext" and
"/usr/share/java/ext" and, for backward compatibility,
extension_dir/lib (or extension_dir\lib, on windows). All java
libraries located in these directories are loaded
automatically. Example:

# copy log4j.jar to the java.ext.dirs:
cp log4j.jar /usr/share/java/ext

# start the log4j viewer
java -classpath log4j.jar org.apache.log4j.chainsaw.Main &

# start the JavaBridge, the bridge automatically loads log4j and
# writes its log to the running log4j viewer.
java -jar JavaBridge.jar &

* It is now possible to lock the standalone VM so that certain users
cannot (accidently) create arbitrary files, open connections to other
hosts etc. The file "javabridge.policy" has been added to the
standalone container, a default file is located in the extension
directory and denies almost everything. The policy file can be edited
by using the java jdk "policytool". The new option
java.security_policy can be used to set a custom policy file. Example:
java.security.policy="c:/php5/javabridge.policy".  The following
javabridge.policy file example shows how to allow all users to start
threads and call System.exit():

grant {
  permission java.util.PropertyPermission "*", "read";
  permission java.net.SocketPermission "*", "accept, resolve";
  permission java.lang.reflect.ReflectPermission "suppressAccessChecks";

  permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "exitVM";
  permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "modifyThreadGroup";
  permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "modifyThread";
};

* Long-running background threads which were started from the
request-handling JavaBridge thread now receive an InterruptedException,
when the JavaBridge request-handling thread terminates. Long-running
threads such as printer jobs should catch this signal and terminate
as soon as their job is done.


Version 3.0.8:

* When the tomcat or J2EE JavaBridge.war "back-end" is used without an
Apache or IIS front-end, the JavaBridge context now starts a FastCGI
server automatically. This improves performance by more than 300% and
makes the Apache or IIS front-end obsolete. But it requires that 
php-cgi supports FastCGI. If a FastCGI PHP binary is not available,
the first request hangs 1.5 seconds until the FastCGIServlet times
out, the FastCGIServlet is switched off and the normal PhpCGIServlet
takes over. The JavaBridge.war contains FastCGI PHP binaries for
Solaris and Linux. Windows users must compile a FastCGI PHP executable
themselves.

* Security Enhanced Linux modules are supported. FC5 and RHEL5
introduce a SELinux reference policy with support for binary modules.
The old monolithic policy files have been moved to the security
folder, the new policy files are in security/module and are installed
automatically, if install.sh or RPM binaries are used.

* When arrays are passed to procedures or constructors which accept a
collection, the bridge now preserves the element order (a TreeMap is
used as the backing data structure). However, when one of the array
keys is not an exact number (which means that the php array is not an
array but a dictionary), the bridge discards the TreeMap and copies
all bindings into a HashMap data structure and the order of the
elements is not preserved. Example:

echo new java("java.util.Vector", array(1,2,3));
=> [o(Vector):"1,2,3"]

echo new java("java.util.Vector", array(1,2,"foo"=>3));
=> [o(Vector):"3,1,2"]

echo new java("java.util.HashMap", array(1,2,"foo"=>3));
=> [o(HashMap):{"foo"=3,0=1,1=2}]

* It is now possible to selectively switch off the servlet pipe
context server (-Dphp.java.bridge.no_pipe_server=true) and the
socket context server
(-Dphp.java.bridge.no_socket_server=true). Useful for testing
only.

* Some JVM implementations cannot load native libraries more than
once. When the backend is not running within the GNU java VM ("gcj"),
the dynamic loader does no longer try to load native libraries. 
Modify the java.libpath and the java.classpath settings instead,
e.g.: java.libpath=/usr/lib/php/modules:/usr/local/lib
java.classpath=/usr/lib/php/modules/JavaBridge.jar:/usr/local/lib/jni.jar
or read the documentation of your application server for more information.

* Improved automatic start: On windows it is now possible to use a
wrapper binary, for example: java.wrapper="c:/startJava.cmd",
additional options can be set with (example): java.java="javaw
-Dadd.option". On unix the bridge does no longer "busy wait" for the
backend. It uses select so that the startup time for the php-cli
(including the startup time for the backend) is now less than 100ms,
if a native (compiled) backend is used.

* It is now possible to run php interactively. Example session which
uses jdk1.6 "jrunscript":
# install php-java-bridge*.rpm and php-java-bridge-devel*.rpm
/opt/jdk1.6/bin/jrunscript -l php-interactive
php-interactive> $buf = new java("java.lang.StringBuffer", "Hello");
php-interactive> echo $buf;
[o(StringBuffer):"Hello"]
php-interactive> echo "$buf";
Hello
php-interactive> for($i=0; $i<10; $i++) $buf->append($i);
php-interactive> echo $buf->toString()->length();
15

* A "stream" protocol mode has been added. All java bridge XML
requests between java_begin_document() and java_end_document() are
executed asynchronously. Even for local (unix-domain or pipe) channels
this improves performance dramatically. Compared with SOAP, which
usually sends the XML document in one packet, this mode uses less
resources on the web-server side.

* An install script can be used to install the bridge and the backend:
su -c "sh install.sh --verbose"


Version 3.0.7:

* ./configure --with-java=/opt/compile-time/java,/opt/run-time/java:
it is possible to compile a jre runtime path into the bridge. The
default is empty, i.e. the PATH environment variable will be searched
if the bridge has been set up to automatically start the backend.

* When RunJavaBridge is used, it is possible to start the backend with
a non root uid. For example:

  chown apache:apache /usr/lib/php/modules/RunJavaBridge
  chmod 6111 /usr/lib/php/modules/RunJavaBridge

and java.wrapper = /usr/lib/php/modules/RunJavaBridge in the php.ini
(default is: <extension_dir>/RunJavaBridge) will automatically start
the backend as the apache user.
    
* It is now possible to compile the php java extension without java:
./configure --disable-backend creates only the java.so or php_java.dll.

* java => 1.4.2 is required.

* The windows standalone download is not available anymore. The
php_java.dll is now called "java-x86-windows.dll" and can be found in
the JavaBridge.war download.

* The Linux standalone backend has been removed from the
php-java-bridge RPM download. The linux java.so is now called
"java-x86-linux.so" and can be found in the JavaBridge.war download.

* The Linux RPM has been split into 4 separate RPM files:

  php-java-bridge*.rpm: contains the basic files; java extension for
  PHP/Apache HTTP server and a simple backend which automatically
  starts and stops when the HTTP server starts/stops. The bridge log
  appears in the http server error log.

  php-java-bridge-standalone*.rpm: contains the standalone service
  script. Conflicts with the tomcat backend. The tomcat backend is more
  than 2 times faster but less secure; it uses named pipes instead of
  abstract local "unix domain" sockets. The standalone backend is now
  started as the apache user.

  php-java-bridge-tomcat*.rpm: contains the tomcat backend. Conflicts
  with the standalone backend.

  php-java-bridge-devel*.rpm: contains the development documentation
  and the development files needed to create java applications with
  embedded PHP scripts: JavaBridge.jar, script-api.jar and php-script.jar.

* The JavaBridge.war now contains php 5.1.2 binaries for Solaris
(x86), Linux (x86 and ppc64), Windows (x86).

* php4 is supported again (switch to php5 or php6, if you can).


Version 3.0.3:

* Communication via named pipes: When the backend is running inside a
  Unix servlet engine or application server, the bridge uses named pipes
  instead of TCP sockets. This communication channel is 1.5 times faster
  than unix domain sockets and 2 times faster than TCP sockets. TCP
  sockets are still used on systems which do not support standard Unix
  named pipes (Windows).

* Because of the above change the bridge now works with the "Sun Java
  System Application Server Platform Edition 8" on Unix.

* TCP sockets only listen on the local (127.0.0.1) interface unless
  the system property "php.java.bridge.promiscuous" is set to true.

* The apache jsf "myfaces" implementation, which caused problems with
  various application servers or servlet engines, has been replaced by
  JSF 1.1.01.

Version 3.0.2:

* Backward compatibility with 2.0.8: The java.servlet can now have
  three values:

    On  : Selects the default servlet context, which is
          /JavaBridge/JavaBridge.php

    Off : Switches off the HTTP tunnel

    User: Selects the "current" servlet context. A request:
          http://foo.com/context1/test.php connects test.php to the
          backend: http://<java.hosts[0]>/context1/test.phpjavabridge. 

          Example:
          [java]
          java.hosts=127.0.0.1:8080
          java.servlet=User

          Request:
          http://foo.com/contextA/order.php

          Then order.php sends a PUT request to the backend:
          http://127.0.0.1:8080/contextA/order.phpjavabridge
      
* The servlet mapping for PhpJavaServlet has been
  removed. java.servlet=User or
  java.servlet=/JavaBridge/PhpJavaServlet.phpjavabridge can be used instead.

* When the java VM was started as a child of apache (OPTION#3) and
  apache sent out a kill signal to all childs in its process group, the
  guard process (which observes the VM) could be killed. After that one
  had to kill the java child manually. Since version 3.0.2 the guard
  detaches from the apache process group, too

* The PHP5/PHP6 array access and iterator interface should be much
  faster now. Especially the array access was incredibly inefficient
  as it allocated a new instance of PhpMap for each access.


Version 3.0.1:

* JSR223 API: It is now possible to run php scripts from java. Scripts
  are invoked using a CPS style, a CGI binary is started if necessary
  (if Apache/IIS are not running).

   Example:

   PhpScriptEngine engine = new PhpScriptEngine();
   engine.put("key", "testVal");
   // Hold the script from 127.0.0.1:80 (Apache pool) hostage ...
   engine.eval(new URLReader(new URL("http://127.0.0.1:80/HelloWorld.php")));
   // ... call the php procedure HelloWorld.php::java_get_server_name() ...
   System.out.println(((Invocable)engine).call("java_get_server_name", new Object[]{}));
   // ... and release the script.
   engine.release();

  See the configure option --enable-script.

* Java Server Faces: It is possible to embed php scripts into
  frameworks. Requires php-faces.jar (see configure option
  --enable-faces=<myFaces.jar>). The implementation works with the RI
  and Apache myfaces implementation (included in the unsupported
  folder). See examples/java-server-faces for details.

* PHP 4 is no longer supported (the bridge still works with php4).

* The bridge no longer coerces return values. If you want to 
  cast a java string into a php string, use the cast operator, e.g:

    $string = new java("java.lang.String", "{HelloWorld}");
    $substring = $string->substring(1);
    $substring = $substring(0, $substring->length()-1);

    echo "Result: $substring"; // implicit cast
    echo (string)$substring;   // explicit cast
  
* When running in a servlet engine or application server, the bridge now
  supports a multi-user environment. Example tomcat setup which contains:

    webapps/userA/...
                  WEB-INF/lib/{JavaBridge.jar,php-servlet.jar}
                  WEB-INF/cgi/{php.ini,php-cgi-i386-linux.sh,java.so}
                  {sessionSharing.php,sessionSharing.jsp}
    
    webapps/userB/...
                  WEB-INF/lib/{JavaBridge.jar,php-servlet.jar}
                  WEB-INF/cgi/{php.ini,php-cgi-i386-linux.sh,java.so}
                  {sessionSharing.php,sessionSharing.jsp}


  Browser request for:

    http://myhost.com/userA/sessionSharing.php
    http://myhost.com/userA/sessionSharing.jsp

  Creates cookie with a PATH value: path=/userA


  Same browser request for:

    http://myhost.com/userB/sessionSharing.php
    http://myhost.com/userB/sessionSharing.jsp

  Creates cookie with a PATH value: path=/userB

  
* An administrator may setup a FastCGI PHP server or Apache/IIS as a
  frontend so that users don't have to copy their own php binaries into
  their WEB-INF/cgi/ folder. 
 
  1) Example: Apache/IIS/mod_jk connector:


  internet
  clients  <->  :80--->  Apache/IIS                          --->  J2EE AS
                            |    |                          /  /    |   |
                            |   mod_jk <-- jsp/servlet req./  /     |   |
                            |                                /     jsp  |
                            ---- php                        /           |
                            ---- php  <-- P-J-B PROTOCOL --/           servlet
                                 ...                                     ...

  J2EE port not visible to internet clients. Apache/IIS document root
  not used.

    
  2) Example: a shared document directory:


                :80--->  Apache/IIS
            /                |
           / php req.        ---- php
          /                  ---- php  <--| 
                                  ...     |
  internet                                |
  clients                                 |
          \                               |P-J-B
           \jsp/servlet req.              |PROTOCOL
            \                             |
                                          |
           |--> :8080--> J2EE AS          |
           |                 |            |
           |                 ---- jsp     |
           |                 ---- servlet |
           |                      ...     |
           -------------------------------|

  Apache/IIS and J2EE ports are accessible from the
  internet. Apache/IIS and the J2EE AS share the same document root.

  #2 is the recommended setup. Framework requests (e.g.: hello.jsf)
  go to port 8080, initial requests to :80 can be forwarded to the
  framework using the following php code:

  <?php
  // hello backing implementation
  function jsfValidateEntry(...) {...}
  ...
  // check if we're called from the JSF framework, redirect to
  // self.jsf otherwise.
  function redirect() {
    $target=dirname($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']);
    $name=basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'], ".php");
    header ("Location: http://$_SERVER[HTTP_HOST]:8080$target/$name.jsf");
  }
  java_context()->call(java_closure()) || redirect();
  ?>
